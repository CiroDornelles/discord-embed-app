    "description": "Your life on the road to enlightenment has just begun. Though you fully grasp the tenets and precepts of your chosen Road, you have not yet put them to the test. This may be because you were recently Embraced or because you previously abandoned a former Road (in which case you may also consider taking the Apostate Flaw). With this comes a +1 difficulty in resisting frenzy and RÃ¶tschreck, and you lack an aura tied to your Road. However, you have an easier time changing Roads, if you wish to do so."
