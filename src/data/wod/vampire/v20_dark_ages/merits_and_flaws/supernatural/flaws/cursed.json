    "description": "Someone has placed a curse upon you. Work with the Storyteller to determine the nature of your curse, why you are cursed, and how it manifests. The following examples demonstrate the scale of your misfortune: 1 point - if you betray the trust of another, they will always find out; 2 points - words fail you when you try to urgently describe something you've seen or heard; 3 points - in your hands, tools warp and break; 4 points - everyone you love will eventually mistrust and despise you; 5 points - all your successes and grand schemes are doomed to fold and crumble. Curses can be lifted by reconciling with whoever (or whatever) levied the curse in the first place."
