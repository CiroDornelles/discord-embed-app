    "name": "Repulsive to Animals",
    "points": 2,
    "description": "When you are near, natural animals startle and panic. Unlike the normal disturbance caused by the presence of Cainites, animals near you either bolt in terror or become aggressive and violent, depending on their temperament. This makes riding a horse (or any other riding beast) nearly impossible, as you are unable to calm any creature down with a normal Animal Ken roll. You must use the abilities of the Animalism Discipline or feed the animal some of your blood, which transforms it into a ghoul."
