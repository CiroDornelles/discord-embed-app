    "name": "Thirteenth Generation",
    "points": 2,
    "description": "By some strange twist of the supernatural, you were Embraced by a member of the Twelfth Generation. Your sire may not have even expected this to come to pass, and it certainly worries the powers-that-be, for you are something that should surely not exist. The difficulty of any rolls to activate your Disciplines is increased by one. At Storyteller discretion, you may also face other increased difficulties when you brush up against those who are frightened or suspicious of what you are. Strongly consider taking the Cannot Embrace or the Weak Blood Flaws as well."
