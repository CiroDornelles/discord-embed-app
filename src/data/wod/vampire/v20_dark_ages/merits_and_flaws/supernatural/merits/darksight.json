    "description": "Your character sees in the darkness the way others see in light. Even in the complete absence of light, she sees perfectly. She suffers no penalties for darkness. Additionally, she catches glimpses of the otherworldly. She sees ghosts as if they were material, but only while in the dark. More than a candle's light negates this ability."
