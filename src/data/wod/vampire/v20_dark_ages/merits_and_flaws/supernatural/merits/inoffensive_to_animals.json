    "description": "Not all of the curses of unlife have fallen upon you. Your presence does not disturb natural animals; instead, they treat you as they would any ordinary mortal. This will not stop a mother bear from defending her den, but will negate the inconvenience of having to explain why the farmer's dog is so afraid of you. Creatures with a connection to the occult (such as crows, owls, or black cats) may still react to your presence, but not in a bad way."
