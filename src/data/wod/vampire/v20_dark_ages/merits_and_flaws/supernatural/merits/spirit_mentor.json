    "name": "Spirit Mentor",
    "points": 3,
    "description": "A ghost has chosen to guide and protect you. This ghost could be the soul of a departed loved one, a former teacher, or close friend or something more sinister, such as a spirit you have bound through dark rituals. The mentor offers you tutelage and support in the same way a mortal or Cainite mentor might, though perhaps less restricted by the conventions of society and the inconveniences of (un)living flesh. Your spirit mentor may also need to be called upon by a specific rite or an incantation. With a suitable explanation and Storyteller permission, this Merit may also be used to represent the mentorship or another kind of supernatural creature."
