    "description": "Transcendent love binds you to another and vice versa. You have the kind of relationship found only in legends and bardsong. There is nothing you would not do for each other. This depthless, unconditional love grants you tremendous might, making you able to overcome impossible obstacles. Once per story, you may automatically succeed on any one roll, no matter how many successes it would require, so long as it is done on your beloved's behalf. If your lover is a Storyteller character, he or she may do the same as if he or she possessed this Merit. If your lover is another player character, he or she must also take this Merit. True Love is not one-sided."
