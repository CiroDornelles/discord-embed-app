    "description": "By some wicked fortune, you are extremely difficult to permanently kill. When a roll would result in your death, immediately reroll it. If the roll succeeds, you walk away from the lethal incident alive, but down one life. You may reroll such near-fatal rolls up to nine times. When your second chances are expended, you will face Final Death like anyone else."
