    "description": "Ghosts, spirits, and shades speak to you. You may have had this talent in your mortal life, or it may be a new ability granted by your Embrace. By spending a moment in meditation, you may ask the spirits who visit you for their aid. They are ready and willing to help you in whatever way they can (most often by providing information), but they always ask a favor in return. The severity of this favor should be in line with the task given to the spirits."
