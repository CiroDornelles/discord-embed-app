    "description": "Fortune smiles upon you. The variable point costs reflect just how much you have been blessed by luck. At 1 point, you have a knack for being in the right place at the right time. At 3 points, you regularly find yourself coming out ahead in games of chance. At 5 points, you are blessed with extraordinary good fortune. A number of times per day equal to the points you have in this Merit, you may reroll a failed roll and take the second result. Lucky and Unlucky are not mutually exclusive, but for simplicity's sake, the same roll cannot be modified by both at once."
